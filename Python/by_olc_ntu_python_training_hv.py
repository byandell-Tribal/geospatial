Welcome to the **ESIIL-Oglala Lakota College-Navajo Technical University** GIS & Python Training.

My name Nate Quarderer and I'm the Education Director at the Environmental Data Science Innovation & Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). I'm joined by my good friends and colleagues Elsa Culler (Education Trainer) and Jim Sanovia (Tribal Resilience Data Scientist), also from ESIIL. Today we're going to demonstrate for you some GIS + Earth Data Science (EDS) applications using Python.

* In **Part 1 (Working with Spatial Data in Python)** we'll show you how to create maps using `geopandas` and data from the U.S. Census Bureau, specifically **The American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) Areas Shapefile:** https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2020-nation-u-s-american-indian-alaska-native-native-hawaiian-aiannh-areas

* In **Part 2 (Working with Time-Series Data in Python)** you will learn how to access data from the [Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily) at **NOAA**. We will then use those data to create a time-series plot of temperature or precipitation over time using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

# Part 1: Working with Spatial Vector Data in Python

### **About Spatial Vector Data**

Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x, y values) known as vertices that define the ‚Äúshape‚Äù of the spatial object. The organization of the vertices determines the type of vector that you are working with. There are three types of vector data:

**Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate. Examples of point data include: sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.

**Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This line is composed of a series of segments, each ‚Äúbend‚Äù in the road or stream represents a vertex that has defined x, y location.

**Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and ‚Äúclosed‚Äù. Thus, the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or countries are often represented by polygons.

"""# Part 2: Working with Time-Series Data in Python

Here we're using the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) [Access Data Service](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/support/access-data-service-api-user-documentation) application progamming interface (API) to request data from their web servers. We will be using daily summary data collected as part of the [Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND) program at NOAA.

For this example we're requesting data near **Kyle, SD** (station ID USC00394630) located on the Pine Ridge Reservation (**43.4402¬∞, -102.1431¬∞**).
